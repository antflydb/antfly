## PyTorch CUDA training reduction arithmetic

The resident FP32 training normalization in
`zig/pkg/inference/src/ops/cuda/kernels/gliner25_layer_norm.cuh` and softmax in
`zig/pkg/inference/src/ops/cuda/kernels/gliner25_softmax.cuh` adapt reduction
arithmetic from PyTorch v2.9.1
(`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/layer_norm_kernel.cu`, `block_reduce.cuh`, and
`PersistentSoftmax.cuh`, and `SoftMax.cu`). The shared log-softmax primitive
uses the same persistent and wide-row reduction arithmetic. The isolated CUDA 12.8 GELU and SiLU arithmetic in
`zig/pkg/inference/src/ops/cuda/artifacts/gliner25_training_math.cu` follows
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/ActivationGeluKernel.cu` and
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/ActivationSiluKernel.cu` from the same version and
uses the same license below. The FP32 reduction planner and kernels in
`zig/pkg/inference/src/ops/cuda/reduction_plan.zig` and that CUDA artifact
adapt `aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/Reduce.cuh` and
`aten/src/ATen/native/SharedReduceOps.h` from PyTorch 2.9.1 under the same license.
The FP32 gradient-clipping norm profile in the same artifact also follows
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/ForeachReduceOp.cu`, `MultiTensorApply.cuh`,
`block_reduce.cuh`, and `Reduce.cuh` from that version under the same license.
The deterministic gather-backward reduction in the same CUDA artifact adapts
`indexing_backward_kernel_stride_1` from
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/Indexing.cu` in that version. The binary-loss
VJP preserves scalar-power and derivative operation order from
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/PowKernel.cu` and
`torch/csrc/autograd/FunctionsManual.cpp` under the same license. The saved-output
sigmoid forward/backward arithmetic follows
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/UnarySpecialOpsKernel.cu` and
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/BinaryMiscBackwardOpsKernels.cu` from that version.
The training arithmetic was compared with
`aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/Embedding.cu` and `EmbeddingBackwardKernel.cu`
from PyTorch v2.9.1 under the same license to diagnose embedding-gradient
accumulation order. No PyTorch source is copied into this repository. The embedding-backward profile in the same CUDA training
artifact adapts their small-input chunk and large-input partial reduction
orders, reusing native stable integer routing. The profiled fused AdamW kernel
also adapts `aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/fused_adam_utils.cuh` from that pinned
version, preserving scalar precision and explicit moment accumulation order. The noisy-OR
consistency derivative preserves the boundary-loss definition from the pinned
Fastino source and the same PyTorch FP32 primitive/reduction ordering.

## GLiNER2.5 boundary attention

The self-contained CUDA boundary-attention kernels are original Antfly code.
Their FP32 masking, softmax, and gradient results were validated against the
pinned PyTorch reference during development; no PyTorch, ATen, CUTLASS, or CUB
source is included or required to build or run them.

## CUB deterministic scan arithmetic

The FP32 deterministic scan in `gliner25_training_math.cu` specializes PyTorch
v2.9.1 `ATen/cuda/cub.cuh` and CUB warp-scan/block-reduction arithmetic. CUB
reference headers were inspected from CUDA 13.2; parity is independently checked
against PyTorch 2.9.1+cu128, including multiple blocks and multiple tiles. The
implementation has no CUB header or library dependency at build or runtime.

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
