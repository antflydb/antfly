# Inference preparation and execution

GGUF, safetensors and imported ONNX models share preparation and execution
contracts. Architecture adapters describe model semantics and checkpoint layouts;
backends retain their tuned kernels and whole-model implementations. Deployment
uses the existing platform and driver interfaces without an external inference
framework.

## Ownership

Paths below are relative to `zig/pkg/inference/src/`.

| Owner | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `architectures/model_definition.zig` | Backend-independent configuration and loaded weight sources |
| `models/session_contract.zig` | Resolved task, processor, padding, pooling, normalization and modality semantics |
| `backends/session.zig` | Published session contracts and typed backend acquisition across wrappers |
| `backends/compute_context.zig` | Common backend construction, exact typed imports and shared context lifetime |
| `execution/program.zig` | Optimized IR, composed node mappings and input/output/weight/state bindings |
| `execution/executable.zig` | Preparation, reusable execution, output placement and optional diagnostics |
| `execution/model_candidate.zig` | Admission and dispatch of specialized whole-model implementations |
| `execution/physical_buffers.zig` | Assigned outputs, transfers, workspace and bounded invocation frames |
| `graph/decode_state_runtime.zig` | KV/recurrent/paged state ownership and advancement |

`execution/root.zig` exposes the common `ModelProgram`, `prepare`, `Executable`
and `BackendContext` boundary. Imported, directly constructed and traced graphs
use the shared fixed-point optimizer. Public and state bindings follow composed
node mappings through rewrites. Already analyzed graphs can borrow their cached
analysis and immutable weights during shape specialization.

## Execution invariants

- Select a backend or specialized candidate using dtype, shape, layout, storage,
  semantics and required features. A model candidate may decline before
  submission; errors after submission propagate without replaying partially
  advanced state through another implementation.
- Separate legality from profitability. Placement accounts for computation,
  launches and transfers while preserving exposed outputs and stateful regions.
  Unsupported signatures fail explicitly or use an observable admitted fallback.
- Bind eligible operations to planned physical outputs and workspace. Native
  schedules and compatibility arenas remain available behind their existing
  admission rules. Logical lifetimes include reordered submissions and aliases.
- Retain storage leases for views and published results across frame reuse,
  executable eviction and producing-session teardown. External contexts must
  outlive values that do not retain their context themselves.
- CUDA capture retains stable operand, output and workspace addresses. Completion
  protects reuse and retirement; captured executables retire before their storage
  owners. Reset and cancellation preserve the existing state/capture guards.
- Resident stage contracts keep intermediates on their admitted backend. Explicit
  host export reads directly from the producer. Typed transfers preserve storage
  bytes or reject the operation; they do not silently convert through F32.
- Diagnostics record actual dispatch, allocation/reuse, transfers and bytes,
  cache behavior and fallback. Nested transfer audits cannot weaken an outer
  strict policy. Planner-only assertions do not establish execution parity.

## Kernel ownership and validation

`ops/kernel_descriptor.zig` describes operation semantics and requirements;
`ops/kernel_geometry.zig` shares geometry with legality checks. Backend plans
retain SIMD/BLAS, packed quantization, native GPU schedules and profitable region
fusions. Compile-time recipes share GGUF encoding mathematics without imposing
one accumulation or scheduling policy on every backend.

See [kernel authoring](kernel-authoring.md) for source ownership, typed schedules,
regeneration, source identities and hardware qualification. Portable Tile model
execution remains a prototype; its scope and commands are in
`zig/pkg/inference/src/tile/README.md`.

Preparation and lifetime regressions live with their implementation owners,
including `execution/executable.zig`, `execution/model_candidate.zig`,
`execution/transfer_audit.zig` and `backends/imported_onnx_session.zig`. Run focused
scopes from the inference package with the pinned Zig compiler, for example:

```sh
zig build test-embeddinggemma2 -Dmetal=false -Dcuda=false \
  -Dtest-filter='ModelProgram' -Dtest-filter='prepared physical'
zig build check-kernel-ownership test-tile-kernels
```

Enable the backend under test for physical device coverage. Qualify numerical
changes with independent references, retained native resource/schedule checks,
and controlled baseline/candidate timing before retiring a fast path.
